## New App Ideas - Evaluate and Categorize
1. Color Checker
    * **Category**: Productivity
    * **Mobile**: With pictures taken by a camera and its portability and accessibility to color blind people and non-color blind people alike.
    * **Story**: There are many color blind people out there who want to dress nice or want to choose a specific color over another but cannot distinguish the two. Yes, there are glasses made for them but that is not cheap and accessible for everyone. This would be a more accessible app towards this group of people.
    * **Market**: The primary goal is to help out people who in particular are color-blind, but can be used to help anyone who does not really know how to combine to colors in an outfit, in a home, etc. This would really help out this community a whole lot.
    * **Habit**: This could be used sparsely like when decorating or buying clothes, or it can be used daily like for choosing outfits and/or makeup everyday.
    * **Scope**: This would be a really basic application but its functionality is in its simplicity.
3. Food Frenzy
    * **Category**: Lifestyle/Entertainment
    * **Mobile**: Easily accessible to users on-the-go. Instead of googling 'What am I hungry for?' you can figure it out quicker and in a relatively interesting way. It can also help you locate what is close by or even if you'd like to try something new it could suggest different ideas based off of your past inquiries.
    * **Story**: Every realtionship has encountered the 'What do you want to eat?' question, followed up with an 'I don't know' or an 'You decide!'. Now they can both decide and have a little fun while doing it. Saves time and frustration.
    * **Market**: All indecisive people, (like myself) who can never decide what they want to eat. I am pretty confident that there are many people out there just like me. Large, considering anyone could use it ranging from couples, to families, to childred. There could be a portion that allows you to choose from cooking at home or eating out.
    * **Habit**: A user may use this app everyday or may just use it once in a while for a spontaneous feeling, depends on how indecisive you are.
    * **Scope**: Definitely Challenging because you would have to brainstorm mini games and incorporate choice selections within them. Maybe it would be interesting to build.
3. Molecule Builder
    * **Category**: Educational
    * **Mobile**: Users who use Science (Scientists, Students, Teachers)can utilize this app to build molecules and see their effects and other interesting aspects of their properties. 
    * **Story**: Students who study science who often google certain questions and get one billion different answers could use this to narrow down their inquiries. 
    * **Market**: This market is quite specific as it caters mostly to students who are learning and scientists who wish to create simulation molecules safely. If this is a form to learn which is catered directly to this market. 
    * **Habit**: Used as needed.
    * **Scope**: In its most basic form it is joining atoms and molecules together to create larger molecules, which is not as complicated as it sounds. With the added features, it can quite complicated and technical not only in the chemistry aspect but also in the programming aspect with it if we wish to make it 3D. However, even if its most simplest form it would still be entertaining to create.
